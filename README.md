Requirements:
- Use any framework (CSS,JS, or none)
- Use the pokemon.json file to load in data
- Image and font assets are included in the package
- Ultimately, we want to see how you develop with what you know best!

Functionality:
- Styled according to mockups
- Filter for Pokemon types, and a range of Pokemon levels  (multiple filters at a time can be applied)
- Here’s an Invision Link to give you idea of functionality: https://invis.io/7F8741Z29#/179357024_Pokedex 
- One the Invision page is loaded, hold down the shift key to see what you can click on. Start by clicking "Filter"
- We’ve also provided a Sketch file, in case you’re more comfortable working from a native format. If you don’t have Sketch, you can download a free 30-day trial here: http://sketchapp.com/
- Submit your code to us so that we can run it locally in Google Chrome. Github, zip file or tarball are fine. Or you can host it yourself.
